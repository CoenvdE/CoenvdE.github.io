My primary objective is to make a meaningful contribution to solving the world's environmental, sustainability and social challenges. To achieve this, I aim to combine my deep interest in nature human behaviour, culture with the study of technology, particularly in the area of Artificial Intelligence. I hope to combine this with my passion for art and creativity to innovate and help the world moving forward.
