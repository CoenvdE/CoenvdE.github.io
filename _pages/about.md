My primary objective is to make a meaningful contribution to solving the world’s challenges on sustainability and social matters. To achieve this, I aim to combine my interest in nature, human behavior and culture with my passion for technology, particularly in the area of Artificial Intelligence. My Bachelor’s degree in Beta-gamma with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence has equipped me with the skills to analyze complex problems from multiple perspectives. My master's degree in Artificial Intelligence has equipped me with the skills to build and apply AI systems to solve real-world problems. As a Teaching Assistant at the UvA, I combined my passion for social interaction and helping people with my expertise in AI, maths and data.

Additionally, I traveled to countries in Asia and Africa, and have lived in Cape Town for 7 months, studying at the University of Cape Town as part of an international exchange program. These experiences have broadened my cultural horizon and provided me with a greater understanding of the global community. I hope to combine this with my passion for art and creativity to innovate and help the world moving forward.
