## Continuing the Example

This is the second chapter in our `example-collection`.

## Section 3: Images and Links

You can include images:

![Placeholder Image](/assets/img/placeholder.jpg "An example placeholder image")

_Remember to replace `/assets/img/placeholder.jpg` with an actual image path in your project._ You might need to create an `assets/img` folder if it doesn't exist.

Links are also straightforward: [Visit Google](https://www.google.com).

You can also link to other parts of your site, like [Part 1](./2024-07-27-example-collection-part1.html) of this series (note: the exact link might depend on your permalink settings).

## Section 4: Collection Navigation

Notice the sidebar (on wider screens) or navigation elements (potentially at the top/bottom). These should automatically list:

1.  A link back to the main "Blogs" collection page.
2.  A list of all chapters in _this_ collection (`example-collection`), allowing users to navigate between Part 1 and Part 2.

This demonstrates the power of organizing posts into collections.
