# HTML Fundamentals

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. In this chapter, we'll cover the basics of HTML.

## What is HTML?

HTML is the foundation of all web pages. It's a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements that you use to enclose or wrap different parts of the content to make it appear or act in a certain way.

## Basic Structure

Every HTML document has a basic structure:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's break down each part:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declaration that tells the browser what version of HTML the page is written in.
- `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document.
- `<title>`: Specifies a title for the document.
- `<body>`: Contains the visible page content.
- `<h1>`: Defines a large heading.
- `<p>`: Defines a paragraph.

## Common HTML Elements

Here are some common HTML elements you'll use frequently:

- Headings: `<h1>` to `<h6>`
- Paragraphs: `<p>`
- Links: `<a href="url">link text</a>`
- Images: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">`
- Lists: `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>`
- Divs: `<div>` (for grouping elements)
- Spans: `<span>` (for styling part of text)

## Next Steps

In the next chapter, we'll dive into CSS to style our HTML elements and make them visually appealing.
