# Chapter 1: Web Development Basics

This is the first chapter of our web development series. We'll explore the fundamentals of building websites.

## The Three Pillars of Web Development

Web development relies on three core technologies:

- HTML (structure)
- CSS (styling)
- JavaScript (interactivity)

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

In this section, we'll set up a basic development environment for web development.

## Your First Webpage

Let's create a simple HTML page:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## What's Next

In the next chapter, we'll dive deeper into HTML elements and structure.
