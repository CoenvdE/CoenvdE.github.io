# Chapter 2: Data Types and Variables

This chapter explores Python's core data types and how to work with variables.

## Basic Data Types

Python has several built-in data types:

- Numbers (integers, floats)
- Strings
- Booleans
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Sets

## Working with Variables

Variables in Python don't need explicit type declarations:

```python
# Integer
age = 25

# Float
height = 1.75

# String
name = "John Doe"

# Boolean
is_student = True
```

## Type Conversion

Python allows you to convert between different data types:

```python
# Convert string to integer
number_str = "42"
number_int = int(number_str)

# Convert integer to string
age = 25
age_str = str(age)
```

## What's Next

In Chapter 3, we'll explore control flow in Python with conditionals and loops.
